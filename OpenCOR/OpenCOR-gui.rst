Graphical User Interface (GUI)
==============================

OpenCOR offers a consistent GUI across the :ref:`different platforms <OpenCOR-supportedplatforms>` it supports. The look and feel of the interface is determined by the :ref:`plugins <OpenCOR-pluginapproach>` which are selected. The first time you run OpenCOR, it will look something like this:

.. image:: /OpenCOR/images/GUIScreenshot01.png
    :align: center
    :width: 360px
    :height: 270px
    :alt: Default looking OpenCOR

There is a central area which is used to interact with files. By default, no file is opened, hence the OpenCOR logo is shown instead. To the sides, there are dockable windows which each provide additional features. Those windows can be dragged and dropped to the top or bottom of the central area:

    :align: center
    :width: 360px
    :height: 270px
    :alt: Use of all docking areas

Alternatively, they can be undocked:

    :align: center
    :width: 233px
    :height: 234px
    :alt: Undocked window

Or even closed, either by directly closing the window itself or by unticking the corresponding menu item (under the <code>View</code> menu, or the <code>Help</code> menu for the Help window):

    :align: center
    :width: 360px
    :height: 270px
    :alt: Showing/hiding windows

To unselect all the :ref:`plugins <OpenCOR-pluginapproach>` will result in OpenCOR looking 'empty':

    :align: center
    :width: 360px
    :height: 270px
    :alt: Empty looking OpenCOR
