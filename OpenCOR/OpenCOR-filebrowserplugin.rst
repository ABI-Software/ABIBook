===================
File browser plugin
===================

The FileBrowser plugin offers a convenient way to access your physical files, remembering the folder or file which was selected when you last ran OpenCOR. By default, it will start with your home directory:

.. image:: /OpenCOR/images/FileBrowserScreenshot01.png
    :align: center
    :width: 360px
    :height: 270px
    :alt: FileBrowser plugin: default view
    :target: ../_images/FileBrowserScreenshot01.png

As you would expect, to double click on a folder will expand its contents, as can be seen by double clicking on the Windows directory:

.. image:: /OpenCOR/images/FileBrowserScreenshot02.png
    :align: center
    :width: 360px
    :height: 270px
    :alt: FileBrowser plugin: double clicking on a folder
    :target: ../_images/FileBrowserScreenshot02.png

On the other hand, to double click on a file will result in it being opened in OpenCOR. The rendering of the file will depend on the current view being selected. In the case of the :ref:`CellML annotation <OpenCOR-cellmlannotationviewplugin>` view, it will look as follows:

.. image:: /OpenCOR/images/FileBrowserScreenshot03.png
    :align: center
    :width: 360px
    :height: 270px
    :alt: FileBrowser plugin: double clicking on a file
    :target: ../_images/FileBrowserScreenshot03.png

Folders and files can also be dragged from the File Browser window and dropped onto the :ref:`file organiser <OpenCOR-fileorganiserplugin>` window.
