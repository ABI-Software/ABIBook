Coordinate Systems
==================

Coordinate system is a system for assigning an n-tuple of numbers or scalars to each point in an n-dimensional space. It anchors the regions within the real world. Coordinate system can have different types such as:

* Rectangular cartesian
* Cylindrical polar
* Spherical polar
* Prolate spheroidal
* Oblate spheroidal

There is a global (world) coordinate system aligned with 3D rectangular cartesian space.

Coordinate system has the following attributes:

* User number
* Finished tag
* Type
* Number of dimensions
* Focus (for prolate-spheriodal system only)
* Origins
* Orientation
