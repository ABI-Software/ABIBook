Working with workspaces in the Physiome Model Repository
========================================================

All models in the Physiome model repository exist in :term:`workspaces`, which are `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_ repositories that can be used to store any kind of file. Mercurial is a distributed version control system (DVCS).


In order to create your own workspaces, you will first need to create a repository account by registering at `www.models.physiomeproject.org <http://www.models.physiomeproject.org>`_. Near the top right of the repository page there will be links labelled *Log in* and *Register*. Click on the register link, and follow the instructions.

Your workspace container
========================

Workspaces will soon be created with automatically generated IDs. This will eliminate the use of the workspace container.

Creating a new workspace
========================



Uploading files to your workspace
=================================

* Clone new workspace
* Add files to cloned workspace
* Commit files (Hg)
* Push to repository (Hg)

Alternatively, use OpenCOR.
