   Exposure
      A publicly available page that provides access to and information about a specific revision of a workspace. Exposures are used to publish the contents of workspaces at points in time where the model(s) contained are considered to be useful.
      
      Exposures are created by the PMR software, and offer views appropriate to the type of model being exposed. CellML files for example are presented with options such as code generation and mathematics display, whereas FieldML models might offer a 3D view of the mesh.

   Workspace
      A Mercurial repository hosted on the Physiome Model Repository. This is essentially a folder or directory in which files are stored, with the added feature of being version controlled by the distributed version control system called Mercurial_. 

   User folder
      A folder on the Physiome Model Repository, created automatically when you register your user-name, which is used to store all of your workspaces. 
      
      The purpose of the user folder is to avoid workspace name clashes - users Jane and Bob can both have a workspace called *great_model_1*, for example.

   Embedded workspace
      A Mercurial concept that allows workspaces to be virtually embedded within other workspaces.

   Fork
      A copy of the workspace which includes all the original version history, but is owned by the user who created the fork.

   Synchronize
      Used to pull the contents or changes from other Mercurial repositories into a workspace via a URI.
