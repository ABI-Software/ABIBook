Physiome Model Repository web interface reference
=================================================

.. sectionauthor:: Dougal Cowan

This document describes the various components of the :abbr:`PMR (Physiome Model Repository)` web interface, which provides access to most of the functions of the PMR software via a web browser.

Physiome Project, CellML, and FieldML views
===========================================

The Physiome Model Repository can be accessed via three different URLs, each of which gives a specific view of the repository:

* http://models.physiomeproject.org - presents an index page that lists the CellML model categories, as well as a link to a list of FieldML models.
* http://models.cellml.org - presents an index page that only lists the CellML model categories. The page logo is the CellML logo instead of the Physiome logo.
* http://models.fieldml.org - presents an index page that lists FieldML models.

Each URL also provides a contextual search. Searching on the FieldML or CellML URLs will only yield FieldML or CellML results respectively, whereas all model types are included in search results using the Physiome Project URL.

Guest view
==========

Browsing the PMR without logging in means you will be restricted to viewing published :term:`workspaces` only. Browsing the repository in this way is only useful for searching, viewing, and downloading published models.

The main navigation bar will only show the *Models Home* and *Exposures* buttons.

The search box at the top right hand side of the page can be used to find published workspaces or exposures using words such as Author name, physiological or biological terms, or other specific words of interest.

Registered view
===============

Logging in to the repository will provide you with a range of additional functions in the PMR web interface.

An addtional option appears in the navigation bar when you are logged in to the repository site, called *My Workspaces*. Clicking on this will show you a page that lists all of the workspaces you have created on the repository. The page also contains a link to your *workspace container*, where you can create new workspaces and manage existing ones.
