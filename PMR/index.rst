PMR user documentation
======================

The documentation found here is mainly aimed towards providing information to users of the `Physiome Model Repository <http://models.physiomeproject.org>`_. This includes users interested in obtaining and running models from the respository, and those who wish to add models to the repository.

If you wish to deploy an instance of the repository software, please see the `buildout repository`_ on GitHub.
