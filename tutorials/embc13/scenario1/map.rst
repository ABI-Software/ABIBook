A new image segmentation study
==============================

In this part of the tutorial, we use the :ref:`MAP client <MAP-index>` software to create a new workflow which will take a set of images, from the model repository, and apply an automated image segmentation algorithm to them which will produce a data point cloud.

Before beginning this tutorial, you need to have the MAP client installed on your machine. Please follow the :ref:`MAP-install-setup`.

The remainder of this tutorial can be found in the MAP documentation, :ref:`MAP-tutorial-create`.
