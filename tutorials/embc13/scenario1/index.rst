============================
Creating a new piece of work
============================

In the physiome model repository (PMR) a complete piece of work is stored in a :term:`workspace`. Each workspace is a :term:`Mercurial` repository, which allows PMR to maintain a complete history of all changes made to every file it contains. In this tutorial we take you through the creation of a new piece of work which will be stored in a PMR :term:`workspace`. When interacting directly with Mercurial, this tutorial demonstrates how to work with the repository using TortoiseHg, which provides a Windows explorer integrated system for working with Mercurial repositories.

::

  Brief mention of the equivalent command line versions of the TortoiseHg
  actions will also be mentioned, so that these ideas can also be used without
  a graphical client, and on Linux or OS X and similar systems. These will be denoted
  by boxes like this.

This tutorial requires you to have:

* A Mercurial client such as `TortoiseHg <http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/>`_ or `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_ installed;
* The :ref:`OpenCOR <OpenCOR-index>` CellML modelling environment and/or the :ref:`MAP <MAP-feature-demonstration>` workflow tool installed;
* A text editor such as `Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ or `gedit <http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/>`_
