==========================
Reproducing published data
==========================

In the Physiome Model Repository (PMR), a complete piece of work is stored in a :term:`workspace`. Each workspace is a :term:`Mercurial` repository, which allows PMR to maintain a complete history of all changes made to every file it contains. In this tutorial, we take you through the process of reproducing an existing piece of *"published"* work - commonly, the first stage in establishing a new project which builds on previous discoveries.
