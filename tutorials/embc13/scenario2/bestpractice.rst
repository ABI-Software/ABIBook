Some tips for best practice:
   - It is essential to use a Mercurial client to obtain models from the repository for editing. The Mercurial client is not only able to keep track of all the changes you make (allowing you to back-track if you make any errors), but using a Mercurial client is the only way to add any changes you have made back into the repository. Some tools, like :ref:`MAP <MAP-feature-demonstration>`, will hide the Mercurial details from the user.
   - By making your work publicly available in standard formats you significantly enhance the ability of other scientists to make use of your work. Similarly, when embarking on a new study it is worth checking the various repositories for existing work that you might be able to build on - such work should normally be discovered during a literature search.
