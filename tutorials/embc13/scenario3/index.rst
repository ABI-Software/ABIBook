============================================
Find an existing piece of work and extend it
============================================

In the preceeding tutorials, you have learnt how to create a new piece of work from scratch using the Physiome Model Respository and how to reproduce a *"published"* result. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to take an exisiting piece of work, stored in a public :term:`workspace`, and develop it further to address a new goal.

Demonstrate reuse and extensibility
   - create new workspace, embed/copy/link to existing (previous) data
   - make changes
   - expose

The tasks we actually do will depend on MAP Client and OpenCOR features available. Examples might be:
   - fit existing model to new data (set of images?)
   - copy CellML model/workspace and use text editor to swap one channel for a more complicated one and compare the simulation results.
   - apply a new segmentation algorithm to existing images.
   - find some muscle models in repository and use them with some simply python script the user could edit?
