Developing the Virtual Physiological Human: Tools, Techniques and Best Practices for Data Exchange, Storage and Publication
===========================================================================================================================

We will demonstrate tools, techniques and best practices that aid scientists in the development and application of computational models and simulation experiments in their work toward the creation of a virtual physiological human. The Physiome Model Repository (PMR) provides a framework for the storage, curation and exchange of data. By using standards suitable to their data, scientists maximise their ability to reuse existing knowledge and enable others to make use of their achievements in novel work. Annotations ensure scientists are able to find existing data and are also able to correctly interpret and apply the data in their own work. The tutorial will begin with a series of presentations introducing the central concepts of the PMR, the software tools OpenCOR and MAP client, and some best practice guidelines which facilitate the finding, use, and sharing of data across the Physiome Project. OpenCOR (http://opencor.ws/) is a new editing, simulation and annotation tool for models encoded in the CellML format (http://cellml.org/). The Musculoskeletal Atlas Project (MAP) client is a software framework that integrates disparate software tools into a streamlined workflow of processing steps to achieve specific objectives. The initial focus of the MAP client is to segment and mesh medical imaging data to generate computational models of the musculoskeletal system. Following the introductory presentations, the speakers and other members of each of these projects will be available to help attendees work through prepared tutorials addressing various common scenarios that these tools are designed to achieve. These tutorials are designed to help demonstrate and promote practices which will aid attendees in their own work. Attendees are also encouraged to raise issues specifically related to their work with the tutors. Attendees should bring their own computers to participate in the hands-on section of the tutorial
